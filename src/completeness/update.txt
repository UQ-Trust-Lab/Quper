 SpotBus’s relationship to you.
Data Controller for Website Users – 
A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that act as our service providers are “data processors” that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions. With respect to the personal data of our customers or received through our SpotBus websites, SpotBus is a controller in relation to the information that you enter directly into the website about yourself or when you register for an account through your school or school district.
Data Processor for Schools and School Districts.
 – To the extent that SpotBus receives personal information through its customers’ (school or school district) use of SpotBus products or services, SpotBus is a processor and the SpotBus customer is the data controller.
 Individual data subject rights.  
In many of the SpotBus products and services, you will be able to access student information as well as change and delete some of the information by logging into the parent/student account. If you cannot access, correct, or delete the required information on your own, please follow these steps:
For parents/students: SpotBus does not control your personal information. We provide our products and services on behalf of your school or school district. Please contact your institution to exercise your rights of access, rectification, erasure, or restriction of use of personal information. The institution needs to manage your request under applicable laws and SpotBus will support our schools and school districts with such requests.
 For all access requests:
Please email SpotBus at 
[email protected]
 or contact us using the information in the “CONTACT US” section if you want to exercise any of these rights.
When we receive an individual rights request from you, please make sure you are ready to verify your identity. Please be advised that there are limitations to your individual rights. We may limit your individual rights in the following ways: (i) where denial of access is required or authorized by law; (ii) when granting access would have a negative impact on other’s privacy; (iii) to protect our rights and properties; and (iv) where the request is frivolous or burdensome.
In many jurisdictions, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection authority.   A listing of EEA data protection authorities can be found at 
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm.
